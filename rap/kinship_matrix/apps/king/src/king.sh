# Basic execution pattern: Your app will run on a single machine from
# beginning to end.
#
# Your job's input variables (if any) will be loaded as environment
# variables before this script runs.  Any array inputs will be loaded
# as bash arrays.
#
# Any code outside of main() (or any entry point you may add) is
# ALWAYS executed, followed by running the entry point itself.
#
# See https://documentation.dnanexus.com/developer for tutorials on how
# to modify this file.

    set -e -x -v -u

    echo "Value of bed: '$bed'"

    # The following line(s) use the dx command-line tool to download your file
    # inputs to the local file system using variable names for the filenames. To
    # recover the original filenames, you can use the output of "dx describe
    # "$variable" --name".

    dx download "$bed" -o input.bed
    dx download "$bim" -o input.bim
    dx download "$fam" -o input.fam

    # Fill in your application code here.
    #
    # To report any recognized errors in the correct format in
    # $HOME/job_error.json and exit this script, you can use the
    # dx-jobutil-report-error utility as follows:
    #
    #   dx-jobutil-report-error "My error message"
    #
    # Note however that this entire bash script is executed with -e
    # when running in the cloud, so any line which returns a nonzero
    # exit code will prematurely exit the script; if no error was
    # reported in the job_error.json file, then the failure reason
    # will be AppInternalError with a generic error message.
